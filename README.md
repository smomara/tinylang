# TinyLang

TinyLang is a really simple compiler written in C that I wrote while going through the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

While learning assembly language, I grew fascinated with how compilers translate to machine language. I thought the best way to learn about compilers was to build one myself.

I'm planning to add to this project by completing all the challenges in the book. After that, I might add some unique features.

## How to Use TinyLang
1. **Clone**
```bash

2. **Navigate**
```bash
cd tinylang # enter the project directory
```
3. **Build**
```bash
make # to make the executable
```
4. **Run**
```bash
./tinylang # to run the REPL
./tinylang [FILE] # to run a specific file
```
5. **Clean**
